- Viewing events on a monthly calendar.
- Drag-and-drop to move events across resources and days.
- Adding new events with a click.
- Deleting events with a confirmation prompt.
- Navigation between months and a "Today" button to return to the current month.

# Three Things I Learned:
  1. Effective state management with React hooks.
  2. Implementing drag-and-drop functionality.
  3. Structuring a responsive and interactive calendar UI.

# Most Difficult Part:
  Implementing the drag-and-drop functionality was the most challenging aspect. I tried multiple approaches, but encountered several minor errors that were difficult to resolve.

# What I Would Do Differently:

  Given more time, I would focus on refining the drag-and-drop feature by debugging these errors more thoroughly. As a fresher with limited industry experience, I recognize that 
  these challenges provided valuable learning opportunities, and I would work on enhancing my debugging skills and understanding of event handling to improve the overall implementation.
